## Repository Link

Before running the application, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url [https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu)
pip install Pillow
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pandas
Note: The PyTorch installation command above is for CPU-only. If you have a CUDA-enabled GPU, please refer to the official PyTorch website (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for the appropriate installation command.   

Setup and Instructions
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME)
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
Navigate to the Application Directory:

Bash

cd app
Run the Flask Application:

Bash

flask run
(You might need to set the FLASK_APP environment variable: export FLASK_APP=__init__.py before running flask run).

Alternatively, you can run it directly:

Bash

python __init__.py
The application will typically start on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Open this URL in your web browser.

Model Information
Model Architecture: The application uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the ResNet50 architecture as its feature extractor, followed by fully connected layers to predict each of the four attributes.
Training Data: The model was trained on a dataset of fashion product images and their corresponding attributes.
Training Note: For rapid prototyping and due to computational resource and time constraints, the model was trained and evaluated on a subset of the full dataset. While this allowed for quicker development, the model's performance and generalization ability can be significantly improved by training on the complete dataset with more extensive training epochs and potentially GPU acceleration.

API Endpoint
The web application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and receiving predictions. The main page (/) serves as the upload form, and the predictions are displayed on the same page after processing.

Example Usage
Open the application in your web browser (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
Click the "Choose File" button to select an image of a fashion product from your local machine.
Click the "Upload" button.
The application will process the image and display the predicted attributes: Base Colour, Article Type, Season, and Gender.
Further Improvements
This project can be further enhanced in several ways:

Training on the Full Dataset: Training the model on the entire dataset will likely lead to significantly better accuracy.
GPU Acceleration: Utilizing a GPU for training will drastically reduce training time.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with different hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, optimizer, etc.) can optimize model performance.   
More Sophisticated Model Architectures: Exploring more advanced CNN architectures or incorporating attention mechanisms could improve prediction accuracy.
Error Analysis: Analyzing misclassified images can provide insights into model weaknesses and guide further improvements.   
Deployment: Deploying the Flask application to a production-ready server for wider accessibility.
